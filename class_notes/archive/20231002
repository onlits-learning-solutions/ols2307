	Problem Statement - Resume Builder
		Resume is one of the most important document possessed by a
		job seeker. But many a times, especially freshers struggle to 
		render a proper resume. The aspirants face difficulty in finding
		contents for their resume and arranging them. Most people are
		not very friendly with word processing resulting in poorly
		formatted resume.  This is where my solution works. I propose
		an application which will fetch required information from the
		users and produce a functional and contemporary resume for them.
